E4: HYSTERESIS AND BIMODALITY EXPERIMENT RESULTS
======================================================================

## Mean φ by k and Sweep Direction

   k |   Sweep Up | Sweep Down |   Variance
--------------------------------------------------
   2 |       0.00 |       0.00 |      0.000
   3 |       0.00 |       0.00 |      0.000
   4 |       0.00 |       0.00 |      0.000
   5 |       0.25 |       0.00 |      0.094 **
   6 |       0.00 |       0.00 |      0.000

** = max variance (boundary indicator)

## Bimodality Analysis

Binary response ratio: 100.0%
Is bimodal (>90% binary): True

## Variance Analysis

Max variance at k=5 (var=0.094)

## Hysteresis Analysis

Transition k (sweep up):   None
Transition k (sweep down): None
Hysteresis gap: None
Has hysteresis: False

## Interpretation

→ BIMODAL: Responses are mostly all-or-nothing (0 or 1),
  suggesting discrete mode switching rather than graded belief.
→ VARIANCE SPIKE at k=5: Phase boundary detected.
  High variance near boundary suggests sensitivity to small perturbations.
